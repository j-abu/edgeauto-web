# edgeauto-web



The portal allows end users to replay data collected from previous driving sessions. The data is displayed in a table, allowing users to plot up to 3 arbitration IDs by selecting an entry. Also featured is a map showing the path a vehicle took for the duration of the driving session.

This folder contains all the files used for the web portal displayed on the front end.

App created with Nodejs/Reactjs.

**Node 10.15.1**

**Yarn 1.13.0**

## Documentation

**server.js**

Responsible for setting proxy(from port 3000 to port 1776) and starting the node server.

**routes/routes.js**

Contains the API call definitions(SQL statements) for use by the react application.

To retrieve all available sessions(`/sessions`):

`SELECT DISTINCT session_id FROM message`

To retrieve all relevant data for a specific session(`/session/vid/sid/`):

`SELECT arb_id, message, cantime, latitude, longitude FROM message WHERE session_id=?`

**data/config.js**

Contains credentials for mysql database connection.

**client/src/App.js**

Application code for web portal.

On page load, an API call to fetch all available sessions(`/getsessions`) is made in the `componentDidMount()` method.

Selecting a session and clicking "load" will make an API call(`/session/vid/sid`) to fetch all relevant data for the selected session via the `getDataForSession()` method.

Session data is stored in a hashmap with the arbitration ID as a key and an object as a value. The object has two members: name and a nested hashmap with time as a key and messages as values:

`HashMap<aid, {name, HashMap<time, message>}>`

Geographical map data is stored in a separate hashmap on session load, with time as a key and an object as value. This object has 2 members, lat and lng:

`Hashmap<time, {lat,lng}>`

Any changes the app makes to the data table, plots or map marker are made through `this.setState({...})`. This forces Reactjs to rerender the componenets instantly.

The data table takes the argument `data={this.state.currentData}` to populate its rows. The state `currentData` is an array of objects with 3 members; name, id and bytes. `currentData` is updated every 300ms.

The plots take the arguments `data={this.state.firstChart}`, `data={this.state.secondChart}` and `data={this.state.thirdChart}` respectively. These arguments are objects with properties specified by [react-chartjs2](https://github.com/jerairrest/react-chartjs-2). These properties are set once a row in the data table is clicked.  

The geographic map takes the argument `center={this.state.center}` and a polyline and marker are drawn on the map with the arguments `positions={this.state.driverPath}` and `position={this.state.latlng}` respectively. `driverPath` is updated on session change, while `marker` has an initial starting value(the starting position) and is updated every 1000ms.
